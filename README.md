### Pies and Pronunciations  

### Native American Discovery and Use

### Early European Encounters

### Reclaiming Enslaved Knowledge

### Foraging vs. Cultivation

### Pecan as Commodity 
The shift from foraged to cultivated following the invention of pecan grafting saw a change in attitude toward the pecan nut. Particularly, between the 19th and 20th centuries, the propagation of the pecan transformed it from a native nut to a commercialized commodity. The knowledge of, and ability to, graft pecans allowed southern landowners to transform it into a business venture— one that became steadily popularized as others realized how easy and profitable it was to grow the versatile and resilient nut. The popularization of this lucrative business opportunity is apparent in the numerous pamphlets and guides circulated to the public from landowners, all of which educate the reader, a beginner-grower, on how to both grow and tend to a pecan grove, and how to ensure success from it. Specifically, these guides educate the reader on when and where they should grow their pecan groves, what tools they need to use, how to fight off insects and diseases, and more tips to assure proper growth. The opportunity presented by the resilience of the pecan itself, along with the universality of its growing requirements aided by the invention of pecan grafting, led to the commodification of the pecan as a money making crop and business opportunity.

But how exactly did the landowners turn this newfound knowledge into a profitable business? Primarily, companies like The Oak Ridge Pecan Company turned the nut into a commodity by sending out brochures to individuals or other landowners asking them to “invest” in their pecan groves by proposing why theirs will yield the most profit for the investor. These brochures from various pecan companies all follow a similar layout, which first describe the pecan and its use in the business and personal sphere, followed by a proposition of the land being sold and its price. Companies weren’t the only ones profiting off of the pecan, however, as individuals were also selling their pecan-growing knowledge and abilities to the public. Particularly, and as is the case with pecan grower C.A. Yancey, individuals will both sell the pecan trees that they have grown to others and will travel to someone’s land and grow the tree for them. The brochures and catalogs of the latter are quite interesting, in that they find the individual trying to persuade the landowner to invest in their pecan-growing abilities alone, advocating as to why they are so good at what they do. Typical of this persuasion are testimonials at the end of the brochures, which act as an additional push to convince the pecan-grower’s audience that they are truly the best. These brochures are significant because they mark the beginning of the commercialization of the pecan tree and its fruit, as landowners are either advertising and selling pecan trees and plots, or are selling their pecan-growing expertise to the general public, all for profit.

### Paolo's Map of Spanish exploration

When 16th century explorers, such as Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, first came <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="34.328981419887434, -90.79370394592483, 5">from Spain to the American South</span> to see what the New World had to offer, they discovered the country's native nut around the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast Regions. By the time they arrived in Central Texas, they had discovered much of the native Pecan Tree population and recognized San Antonio as a particularly promising site for capitalistic ventures. Specifically, they recognized an area southeast of San Antonio at the confluence of the San Antonio and Guadelupe Rivers which was so plentiful that Cabeza de Vaca named it <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="28.507321, -96.891096, 13">"the river of nuts."</span>

### Paolo's Map of San Antonio

During the period of industrialization and factory processing of the Pecan, San Antonio would become a critical center of the labor rights movement of the United States, when thousands of Mexican American laborers would protest the Southern Pecan Shelling Company's decision to cut wages in what is now known as the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="29.414579644080305, -98.51945869215106, 13">Pecan Shellers' Strike</span> of 1938.

### MK's Map of Oak Alley

The first person to graft a pecan tree, leading to the domestication of the pecan, was Antoine, an enslaved person living in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="30.00449, -90.77604, 16">Oak Alley Plantation</span> in Vacherie, Louisiana. Thus, Oak Alley is marked as the first site of successful pecan propagation. Although Antoine was clearly a very skilled gardener, not much was recorded of him because he was kept as a slave. Nevertheless, Antoine’s skill with grafting and propagating in Oak Alley laid out the future of the pecan industry as we know it today.

### Stef's Map of Pecan Exports to China
Business reports have recorded that starting in the early 2000s (especially in 2013), pecan exports from the United States to China have skyrocketed. This is due to the associated health benefits that pecans can offer individuals, as well as the price of the pecan is more affordable than walnuts. Most exports come from farms in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="31.241, -98.723, 5"> East Texas </span> and <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="32.708, -83.178, 5"> Georgia</span>, then shipped to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="22.3526, 114.1603, 10"> Hong Kong</span>, China.
