### Pies and Pronunciations  

### Native American Discovery and Use

### Early European Encounters

In 1533, Spanish explorers became the first Europeans to come into contact with the pecan of <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="34.328981419887434, -90.79370394592483, 5">North America</span>. Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, one of the leading explorers, recounts his travels through the area southeast of what is now San Antonio, Texas, near the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio Rivers. There, they found a stretch of land on which the fruit of the pecan tree was so numerous that they named it <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="28.507321, -96.891096, 13">"the river of nuts."</span> Interestingly, though, since the pecan bears a striking similarity to the European walnut, as they both belong to the family [Juglandaceae,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglandaceae) Europeans did not, at first, see a reason to cultivate a nut they thought they already enjoyed back home. Moreover, the European association of the pecan with Native Americans may have also contributed to a delayed recognition of the pecan as a delicious nut worth cultivating. In fact, it wasn’t until the turn of the seventeenth century that a French Catholic missionary, Fr. Gabriel Marset, learned from the Native Americans of Illinois that it was distinct from the walnut: “The pecans (it is thus that the fruit of one of the Nut-trees is called) have a better flavor than our nuts in France.”

Even though European acceptance of the pecan as a viable food crop may have been stunted by racial and ethnic discrimination, it does not mean there was no interest at all. Andre Michaux, an eighteenth-century botanist who published one of the first books on the trees of North America, describes the good qualities of the pecan tree, saying that the nuts are “more delicately flavored than those of Europe” and “the fruit is much larger.” Not only does he affirm the nut’s good qualities, but he also asserts that the active cultivation of the pecan by way of grafting the tree would bring it “to a high degree of perfection…and no motive would discourage its propagation.”

Distinct from the customs of foraging and planting nuts from wild pecan varieties, Michaux was proposing the active cultivation and crop farming of new pecan varieties through the technique of grafting. Grafting involves combining the stem, or scion, of one tree with the base, or rootstock, of another tree in order to generate a new tree variety. Successful grafting of the pecan tree, then, meant the creation of pecan varieties which would grow stronger faster, fruit more frequently and abundantly, and produce more delicious nuts. Michaux’s prophetic opinion reveals how the shift in the European relationship to the pecan was marked by more than recognition of a good source of food. Instead, the European impulse to cultivate and perfect the promising nut of the New World marks a definitive shift in the relationship between humans and the pecan.

### Reclaiming Enslaved Knowledge

Grafting the pecan was apparently more difficult than Michaux would have hoped. It wasn’t until 1822 in South Carolina when [Abner Landrum,](https://madpotter-oldcanalpottery.blogspot.com/2010/06/dr-abner-landrum.html) a potter by trade, successfully grafted the pecan tree. But Landrum’s success did not come to fruition. His new trees died before producing nuts and the practice of grafting proved to be difficult for farmers and gardeners alike. One landowner in St. James Parish, Louisiana, Dr. A. E. Colomb, “cut scions (buds and stems) from a particularly impressive pecan tree” and attempted to graft them onto smaller ones. However, they did not survive. So, hoping someone else might succeed, he gave some of his leftover scions to the owner of Oak Alley Plantation, Telesphore J. Roman. It was on this Louisiana plantation along the Mississippi River in 1846-47 that Antoine, an enslaved African American man and a “gardener and expert grafter of Pecan Trees,” became the first person to cultivate an improved pecan variety. After Antoine successfully grafted and cultivated 16 trees of his new variety, Roman had him graft another 110 trees. This he also successfully accomplished, demonstrating both the viability of pecan grafting and the possibility of large scale cultivation of the pecan.

The records from Oak Alley Plantation indicate that Antoine was valued at $1000, and, even though the sales records reveal that the fruit of his new variety was worth $50-75 a barrel, he “received no glory or pay for his botanical feat.” continue biographical portion of Antoine; waiting on source material from library.

Despite its budding success and the initial fruit of Antoine’s craft, grafting was not the only challenge for the new pecan tree. The threat of the Civil War, instability in plantation ownership, and financial difficulties resulted in the clearing of 110 of the 126 grafted trees. Antoine’s pecan variety was nearly cut down and forgotten. However, Antoine’s pecan variety managed not only to survive, but gain national recognition for its superior quality. Following Roman’s sale of Oak Alley, a new owner named Humbert Bonzano was so impressed by the quality of Antoine’s original 16 pecan trees that he decided “to exhibit Antoine’s improved Pecans at the [Centennial Exposition,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Exposition) held in observance of the nation’s hundredth birthday, in Philadelphia.” The judges who observed and tasted the pecans wrote that they were noteworthy for their “remarkably large size, tenderness of shell, and very special excellence.” Rewarded with such a high review, Antoine’s pecan variety took its official name from the event and became known as the “Centennial.” Unfortunately, due to a combination of farming errors and post-war financial difficulties, Antoine’s original trees did not survive beyond the year 1902. Nevertheless, the “Centennial” remains among those varieties enjoyed today, and his success in grafting the first improved pecan variety formed a foundation for the ongoing cultivation of the commercialized pecan.

### Pecan as Commodity 
The shift from foraged to cultivated following the invention of pecan grafting saw a change in attitude toward the pecan nut. Particularly, between the 19th and 20th centuries, the propagation of the pecan transformed it from a native nut to a commercialized commodity. The knowledge of, and ability to, graft pecans allowed southern landowners to transform it into a business venture— one that became steadily popularized as others realized how easy and profitable it was to grow the versatile and resilient nut. The popularization of this lucrative business opportunity is apparent in the numerous pamphlets and guides circulated to the public from landowners, all of which educate the reader, a beginner-grower, on how to both grow and tend to a pecan grove, and how to ensure success from it. Specifically, these guides educate the reader on when and where they should grow their pecan groves, what tools they need to use, how to fight off insects and diseases, and more tips to assure proper growth. The opportunity presented by the resilience of the pecan itself, along with the universality of its growing requirements aided by the invention of pecan grafting, led to the commodification of the pecan as a money making crop and business opportunity.

But how exactly did the landowners turn this newfound knowledge into a profitable business? Primarily, companies like The Oak Ridge Pecan Company turned the nut into a commodity by sending out brochures to individuals or other landowners asking them to “invest” in their pecan groves by proposing why theirs will yield the most profit for the investor. These brochures from various pecan companies all follow a similar layout, which first describe the pecan and its use in the business and personal sphere, followed by a proposition of the land being sold and its price. Companies weren’t the only ones profiting off of the pecan, however, as individuals were also selling their pecan-growing knowledge and abilities to the public. Particularly, and as is the case with pecan grower C.A. Yancey, individuals will both sell the pecan trees that they have grown to others and will travel to someone’s land and grow the tree for them. The brochures and catalogs of the latter are quite interesting, in that they find the individual trying to persuade the landowner to invest in their pecan-growing abilities alone, advocating as to why they are so good at what they do. Typical of this persuasion are testimonials at the end of the brochures, which act as an additional push to convince the pecan-grower’s audience that they are truly the best. These brochures are significant because they mark the beginning of the commercialization of the pecan tree and its fruit, as landowners are either advertising and selling pecan trees and plots, or are selling their pecan-growing expertise to the general public, all for profit.

### Industrialization, Overproduction, and Resistance

The increased popularity of the pecan, as well as the successful cultivation of improved varieties, led to a major boom in pecan trees on orchard land.  Between the years 1900 and 1925, the number of orchard pecan trees in the U.S. went up from 567,000 to 8,733,000, exhibiting the greatest increase in the pecan’s history. A crucial player in this new industry was the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Since farmers tended to focus their planting on just a few of the most fruitful and delicious varieties, the pecan lost a crucial benefit of genetic diversity: the ability to fight off hungry insects. Thus, the USDA’s development of [insecticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide) helped the pecan overcome the threat of unwelcome pests and gained the confidence of farmers who benefitted from the organization’s chemical creativity. Thus, the resilience of the pecan tree in overcoming the challenges of cultivation and commercialization allowed for astronomical increase in pecan production. However, this abundant increase did not cultivate wealth for all.

Unsurprisingly, the ongoing successful cultivation of improved pecan varieties established the pecan as a money making venture. In San Antonio, for example, Julius Seligmann’s Southern Pecan Shelling Company had taken off as a highly lucrative business, accounting for more than three quarters of the nation’s unshelled pecan purchases. But since mechanical advancement did not follow as quickly as pecan growth, Seligmann’s factories still relied on laborers to shell them by hand. His dependance on laborers to shell pecans was not a problem until the country was hit by the Great Depression. Selfishly, Seligmann attempted to maintain his own income by taking advantage of the Mexican American working class. By 1938, Seligmann had cut wages by 20%, reducing weekly earnings to about $2 per week ($60 today) while gaining for himself a net income of $500,000 ($15 million today).

In response to this abhorrent injustice, the laborers, led by a woman named [Emma Tenayuca,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Tenayuca) initiated the Pecan Shellers’ Strike of 1938, a three-month protest that gained international coverage. The strike eventually led to the federal government enacting the [Fair Labor Relations Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938) which resulted in pecan factory workers earning double or even triple what they did before. The tragic irony, however, was that the new law also motivated companies to reduce the number of laborers and invest in pecan shelling machinery. The law enacted to protect laborers resulted in the permanent loss of 10,000 jobs in pecan factories over the next 10 years, and the Pecan Workers Union #172, which led the shellers’ strike, was officially disbanded in 1948. Despite leading the charge in labor rights, the laborers of pecan factories became “the only major group of workers displaced as a direct result” of the Fair Labor Relations Act.

The Pecan Shellers’ act of resistance parallels the pecan’s own resiliency in a period of industrialization characterized by the greed of businessmen and decreased biodiversity. The wild pecan had officially become a domesticated crop, and the Pecan was seen as a tree which exists “to serve not nature’s economy but the human economy.” Even though this period of immense productivity and agricultural advancement may be seen as a feat of human cultivation, it is also marked by the fraught relationship between humans and the natural world. As time went on, the environmental hazards were not always sufficiently heeded, and the narrowing gene pool and reduced naturally occurring varieties of the pecan posed significant challenges for farmers, the USDA, and the pecan itself.

### Trade and Economic Growth 

### Decreased Genetic Diversity

### Wisdom of the Pecan 
The history and resilience of the pecan marks it as a warrior, one able to withstand both natural and human external forces. However, the strength of the pecan is not something that we should just sit back and marvel at. Rather, in the spirit of Indigenous tradition, there are many lessons that humans can take from this wise nut. Potowatami botanist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer has written much about the pecan and its cultural significance for her tribe, a significance that yields teachable moments for all. First, there is the lesson of harmony and reciprocity between humans and nature, those of which cannot properly flourish among methods of commodification, commercialization, and the mass-production of pecans. The Potowatami people used to live among the pecans as if they were one and the same, stepping over them on the ground and filling their pockets with them for journeys, using them as needed and giving back to them by preserving the land they grow on. Now, with the overproduction and mass-production of the nut, this relationship has lost its reciprocity and has become one-sided: a take-take, and not a take-give. The lack of harmony here caused by overproduction, which is telling for more than just the pecan, creates an imbalance that proves lethal for the environment and ecosystem that will persist until eventually there is nothing left to take from. The solution here, then, is rooted in the indigenous knowledge surrounding the pecan to help recreate a reciprocity and harmony in nature. Just because the pecan is a strong and resilient warrior, does not mean that we should take from it until there is nothing left.
