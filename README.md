# Practice Pecan Images

## Paolo's Pecan Image

This is an early 19th century illustration of a the Pecan Nut, with its given Liennaen scientific name of Juglans Olivaeformis. Because of its resemblance to other hickories, it also bears the more <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="391,2115,1874,1809">commonly known name</span>.

### Paolo's Map of San Antonio

When 16th century explorers, such as Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, first came <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="34.328981419887434, -90.79370394592483, 5">from Spain to the American South</span> to see what the New World had to offer, they discovered the country's native nut around the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast Regions. By the time they arrived in Central Texas, they had discovered much of the native Pecan Tree population and recognized San Antonio as a particularly promising site for capitalistic ventures. Later, during the period of industrialization and factory processing of the Pecan, San Antonio would become a critical center of the labor rights movement of the United States, when thousands of Mexican American laborers would protest the Southern Pecan Shelling Company's decision to cut wages in what is now known as the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="29.414579644080305, -98.51945869215106, 13">Pecan Shellers' Strike</span> of 1938.

### MK's Map of Oak Alley

The first person to graft a pecan tree, leading to the domestication of the pecan, was Antoine, an enslaved person living in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="30.00449, -90.77604, 16">Oak Alley Plantation</span> in Vacherie, Louisiana. Thus, Oak Alley is marked as the first site of successful pecan propagation. Although Antoine was clearly a very skilled gardener, not much was recorded of him because he was kept as a slave. Nevertheless, Antoineâ€™s skill with grafting and propagating in Oak Alley laid out the future of the pecan industry as we know it today.

### Stef's Map of Pecan Exports to China
Business reports have recorded that starting in the early 2000s (especially in 2013), pecan exports from the United States to China have skyrocketed. This is due to the associated health benefits that pecans can offer individuals, as well as the price of the pecan is more affordable than walnuts. Most exports come from farms in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="31.241, -98.723, 5"> East Texas </span> and <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="32.708, -83.178, 5"> Georgia</span>, then shipped to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="22.3526, 114.1603, 10"> Hong Kong</span>, China.
