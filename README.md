#### Pies and Pronunciations  
Thanksgiving in America arrives once a year, and friends and family members gather around the country to share a pecan pie. The debate on pronouncing this delicious treat will forever be ongoing. Some say that if you live below the Mason-Dixon line, you pronounce the nut as puh-KHAN, but this is not necessarily true. In fact, one poll concluded that 45% of Southern residents say PEE-CAN, and so do 70% of Northerners[^Ref 1]. We want to know how you say it, cast your pronunciation [here.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TPDNWFK)

Whether you pronounce it PEE-CAN or puh-KHAN, this culinary classic has a history richer and more complex than the ubiquitous popularity of Thanksgiving pies might suggest. As historian James McWilliams has argued, the pecan (Carya illinoinensis) first became an important food source for people in the Americas thousands of years ago due to its high nutritional value and abundance. Moreover, for most of history, humans relied not on cultivated pecans but on wild ones to feed themselves, since wild pecan populations have been unusually resilient and capable of maintaining themselves. In other words, humans adapted to the rhythms and life cycles of the pecan. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, however, pecan cultivation ramped up, as humans began to seek to control pecan production and increase its output. This trend has resulted in numerous potential threats to the pecan, including loss of genetic diversity and potential extinction. While the future of the pecan may currently appear grim, the answer to the problem of the pecan’s future lie within the deep history of its relationship with humans. If we could go back to a more reciprocal, mutually beneficial relationship with pecans, both we and pecans could flourish.

#### Native American Discovery and Use
Native Americans were the first to come into contact with the pecan nut, which they named pakan[^Ref 2]. When Native Americans first came to America some 30,000-12,000 years ago, the pecan was already flourishing, as the abundant nut acted as a plentiful food source for many animals across its native region—which spanned from Northern Illinois to the Gulf Coast, and from Texas to Alabama—while also contributing to biodiversity[^Ref 3]. The pecan became a particularly important Native American staple after a global warming that occurred around 16,000 years ago shifted their migration and agricultural patterns[^Ref 4]. For example, some groups, particularly members of the Caddo nation, ended up along the Mississippi River Valley, (a particularly prosperous location for pecan trees. . .[^Ref 5] Eventually, the pecan became even more popular due to its abundance, resilience, and nutritious components[^Ref 6]. Collecting pecan nuts is fairly easy; gatherers would simply wait for the nuts to fall or throw a stick at the tree to force the pecans down[^Ref 7]. Simple tools like rocks can be used to crack the pecan shell. The nuts also can be boiled and stored for later use and for long periods of time. These attributes make the pecan an accessible and easy nut to forage. Since the pecan tree produced nuts in abundance, there was ample opportunity for individuals to reap the benefits of the plant itself.  In terms of its nutritiousness, “The pecan is a supremely healthy nut. A hundred grams of wild pecans (about two handfuls) pack a nutritional punch: 718 calories, 9.7 grams of protein, 2.4 grams of fiber, 74 grams of fat, and significant doses of critical micronutrients such as iron, potassium, magnesium, beta-carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and ascorbic acid.”[^Ref 8] It made perfect sense, then, that the pecan fit into every aspect of the diets of Native American nations who had access to them.  These groups ate the nut in many different forms and in various ways: “They…pounded them into a powder, applied the pecan dust to corn gruel and bread, worked pecan meal into bison meat, and even boiled nuts to ease the extraction of meat. Others may have fermented pecan powder into an alcoholic beverage called powcohicora.”[^Ref 9]

The pecan, as an essential component of Native American diets, heavily influenced migration patterns due to its specific alternate fruiting and masting (inserting wikidata link for masting here) patterns.[^Ref 10] Specifically, nations like the Comanche, Caddo, and Kickapoo not only based their migration patterns off of the pecan's masting schedule but also may have settled where they did because of their desire to be close to abundant pecan groves.[^Ref 11] They did this in spite of the fact that the pecan’s propensity for alternate masting meant that, depending on the year, some groves would fruit, while others would not.[^Ref 12] Because of the sheer abundance of nuts that the trees would produce, however, Native Americans did not mind fitting their migration patterns around the pecans’ unusual schedule, as “The pecan trees, to an extent, told them where to go. Indians, fully sold on the nut’s worth, followed.”[^Ref 13] The pecan also eventually became a staple in Native American trade, as different groups would carry around baskets of pecans to exchange with other Native American groups.[^Ref 14] Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that Native Americans helped pecan trees spread and flourish since they carried pecans with them when they migrated and planted them in new locations. In other words, even as pecans helped them, they helped the pecans. As Potawotami botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer has written about this relationship, “Our taking returns benefits to them in the circle of life making life, the chain of reciprocity.”[^Ref 15] If Indigenous relations with pecans and pecan trees were largely reciprocal, however, this relationship would change with the arrival of new groups to the Americas.

#### Early European Encounters
In 1533, Spanish explorers became the first Europeans to come into contact with the pecan of North America. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, an explorer who also became a captive of a Native American tribe, recounts being brought to an area southeast of what is now San Antonio, Texas, near the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio Rivers. There, he reunited with his fellow Spaniards and discovered a stretch of land on which the fruit of the pecan tree was so numerous that they named it <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="28.507321, -96.891096, 13">"the river of nuts."</span>.[^Ref 16] Interestingly, though, since the pecan bears a striking similarity to the European walnut, as they both belong to the family <span eid="Q216944">Juglandaceae</span>, Europeans did not at first see a reason to cultivate a nut they thought they already enjoyed back home.[^Ref 17]

Moreover, the European association of the pecan with perceived “uncivilized” Native American ways may have also contributed to a delayed recognition of the pecan as a delicious nut worth cultivating.[^Ref 18] In fact, it was not until the turn of the seventeenth century that a French Catholic missionary, Fr. Gabriel Marest, learned from the Native Americans of Illinois that it was distinct from the walnut. Writing to his Jesuit community back in Europe, he recorded, “The pecans (it is thus that the fruit of one of the Nut-trees is called) have a better flavor than our nuts in France.”[^Ref 19]

Even though European acceptance of the pecan as a viable food crop may have been stunted by racial and ethnic bias, as well as contentment with the familiar walnut, it does not mean there was no interest at all. André Michaux, an eighteenth-century botanist who published one of the first books on the trees of North America in 1803, describes the good qualities of the pecan tree, saying that the nuts are “more delicately flavored than those of Europe” and “the fruit is much larger.”[^Ref 20] Not only does he affirm the nut’s good qualities but also he asserts that the active cultivation of the pecan by way of grafting the tree would bring it “to a high degree of perfection…and no motive would discourage its propagation.”[^Ref 21]

Distinct from the customs of foraging and planting nuts from wild pecan varieties, Michaux was proposing the active cultivation of new pecan varieties through the technique of grafting. Grafting involves combining the stem, or scion, of one tree with the base, or rootstock, of another tree in order to generate a new tree cultivar.[^Ref 22] Successful grafting of the pecan tree meant the creation of pecan varieties that would grow faster, bear fruit more frequently, and produce larger and more delicious nuts. Michaux’s prophetic opinion reveals how the shift in the European relationship to the pecan was marked by more than the recognition of a good source of food. Instead, it was marked by an impulse to cultivate and improve the pecan, which Europeans saw as needing perfection.

#### Reclaiming Enslaved Knowledge
Grafting the pecan was apparently more difficult than Michaux expected. It wasn’t until 1822 in South Carolina when [Abner Landrum,](https://madpotter-oldcanalpottery.blogspot.com/2010/06/dr-abner-landrum.html) a potter by trade, successfully grafted the pecan tree.[^Ref 23] But Landrum’s success did not come to fruition, and no other farmers seemed to build off of his achievement until years later when a Louisiana landowner had an idea.[^Ref 24] In St. James Parish, Louisiana, Dr. A. E. Colomb “cut scions (buds and stems) from a particularly impressive pecan tree” and attempted to graft them onto smaller ones.[^Ref 25] They did not survive. Hoping someone else might succeed, he gave some of his leftover scions to Télésphore J. Roman, the owner of a plantation called Oak Alley.[^Ref 26] It was on this Louisiana plantation along the Mississippi River in 1846-47 that Antoine, an enslaved Creole man and a “gardener and expert grafter of Pecan Trees,” became the first person to cultivate an improved pecan variety.[^Ref 27] Antoine successfully grafted 16 trees of his new variety. Impressed by his work, Roman had him graft another 110 trees. He was successful, demonstrating both the viability of pecan grafting and the possibility of large scale cultivation of the pecan.[^Ref 28]

The records from Oak Alley Plantation indicate that Antoine was just 4 years old when he, along with his mother, father, and brother became property of the Roman family.[^Ref 29] His mother, Zaire, was a spinner of cloth, and his father, Zephyr, occupied the most important position on the plantation: he oversaw the production of sugar.[^Ref 30] Because “Zephyr held this elite role on the Roman Plantation,”[^Ref 31] Antoine grew up in the house his father built with the complicated knowledge that “he was enslaved, and he was also the son of a great man.”[^Ref 32] Antoine cultivated his father’s spirit of greatness as he matured, learning to cooperate with the land while tending his family’s garden behind their slave quarters.[^Ref 33] We cannot know for sure whether Antoine was intentionally trained for his special skill.[^Ref 34] We do know, however, that neither Colomb nor Roman–social elites and talented gardeners in their own right–possessed the capacity to perform Antoine’s craft.[^Ref 35] They relied on his knowledge and  labor, and they profited from his success, but they gave him no credit.[^Ref 36] The sales records reveal that the fruit of his new variety was worth $50-75 a barrel,[^Ref 37] but Antoine “received no glory or pay for his botanical feat.”[^Ref 38] Sadly, Antoine found himself in a world in which profit was king and the exploitation of enslaved labor and knowledge was common, and the pecan he had learned to cultivate would soon face the consequences of the same capitalistic system.

After Télésphore Roman’s death in 1848, care of Oak Alley fell to his wife, Celina.[^Ref 39] In 1859, determined to save his family’s estate from his mother’s mismanagement, Henry Roman received official ownership.[^Ref 40] Due to the political and financial strain experienced throughout the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span>,Henry was forced to sell the property to John Armstrong, who foolishly decided to cut down 110 of Antoine’s 126 pecan trees in an effort to bolster sugarcane production.[^Ref 41] Antoine’s trees were nearly all cut down and forgotten. Antoine’s pecan variety managed not only to survive, however, but also to gain national recognition for its superior quality. By 1870, Oak Alley had a new owner named Humbert Bonzano, who had new plans for the remaining pecan trees.[^Ref 42] Bonzano was so impressed by the quality of Antoine’s original 16 pecan trees that he decided “to exhibit Antoine’s improved Pecans at the [Centennial Exposition,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Exposition) held in observance of the nation’s hundredth birthday, in Philadelphia.”[^Ref 43] The judges who observed and tasted the pecans wrote that they were noteworthy for their “remarkably large size, tenderness of shell, and very special excellence.”[^Ref 44] Rewarded with such a high review, Antoine’s pecan variety took its official name from the event and became known as the “Centennial.”[^Ref 45] Antoine’s variety remains among those enjoyed today, and his success in grafting the first improved pecan variety formed a foundation for the ongoing cultivation of the commercialized pecan.

#### Pecan as Commodity 
Between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, pecan grafting allowed the nut to be grown in a more purposeful and organized fashion, transforming the pecan from a “native nut” to a commercialized commodity.[^Ref 46] Particularly, the knowledge of and ability to graft pecans allowed southern landowners to transform the nut into a business venture, one that became steadily popularized as others realized how easy and profitable it was to grow the versatile and resilient nut.[^Ref 47]

The popularization of this lucrative business opportunity is apparent in the numerous pamphlets and guides circulated to the public from landowners. These pamphlets educated the reader, assumed to be a beginner-grower, on how to grow and tend to a pecan grove and how to ensure successful profit from it. Specifically, these guides educated the reader on when and where they should grow their pecan groves, what tools they needed to use, how to fight off insects and diseases, and more, to assure proper growth.[^Ref 48]
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/CAT31332999/page/n5/mode/2up">

But how exactly did the landowners turn this newfound knowledge into a profitable business? In short, the invention of pecan grafting and the start of active pecan cultivation led to increased agricultural yields, which made the pecan business a reliably lucrative venture for the first time.[^Ref 49] In addition, pecan growers also started turning the pecan and even pecan groves themselves into commodities For example, companies like The Oak Ridge Pecan Company sent out brochures to individuals or other landowners asking them to “invest” in their pecan groves by proposing why theirs will yield the most profit for the investor.[^Ref 50] These brochures from various pecan companies all followed a similar layout, which first described the pecan and its use. Additionally, these brochures include a description of the land being sold and the price per footage. Companies weren’t the only ones profiting off of the pecan, however, as individuals were also selling their pecan-growing knowledge and abilities to the public. Particularly, and as is the case with pecan grower C.A. Yancey, individuals would both sell the pecan trees that they had grown to others and travel to someone’s land and grow the tree for them there.[^Ref 51] The brochures and catalogs from individuals are quite interesting, in that they find the individual trying to persuade the landowner to invest in their pecan-growing abilities— as opposed to those of pecan-growing corporations— advocating as to why they are so good at what they do. Typical of this persuasion are testimonials at the end of the brochures, which act as an additional push to convince the pecan-grower’s audience that they are truly the best.[^Ref 52] These brochures are significant because they mark the beginning of the commercialization of the pecan tree and its fruit, as landowners are either advertising and selling pecan trees and plots or are selling their pecan-growing expertise to other planters, all for profit.

#### Industrialization, Overproduction, and Resistance
The increased popularity of the pecan, as well as the successful grafting and cultivation of improved varieties, led to a major boom in pecan trees on orchard land.  Between the years 1900 and 1925, the number of orchard pecan trees in the U.S. went up from 567,000 to 8,733,000, exhibiting the greatest increase in the pecan’s history.[^Ref 53] Despite this abundant increase, growing pecans on orchard land became a major challenge for pecans and its farmers. Since farmers tended to focus on planting the most fruitful and delicious varieties, the pecan lost its genetic diversity, as well as a crucial benefit of this diversity: the ability to fight off hungry insects.[^Ref 54] Pecans may be resilient and farmers may be knowledgeable, but the genetic uniformity of pecan orchards dealt a potentially lethal blow to the pecan’s capacity to survive its new commercialized context. This new problem needed a new solution.
<param ve-image

       license="Public Domain">

The solution came from an emerging organization of the U.S. Federal Government: the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA’s development of <span eid="Q181322">insecticides</span> helped the pecan overcome the threat of unwelcome pests. It also helped the USDA gain the confidence of farmers, who benefitted from the organization’s chemical creativity.[^Ref 55] At the same time, while insecticides may have allowed farmers to save their agricultural enterprises and gain wealth, they never really addressed the issue of genetic diversity, which was at the root of the problem for the pecan. Nevertheless, pecan growers capitalized on the short-term solution provided by the chemical sciences and were able to gain rapid financial increase as pecan production expanded even more. But this abundant increase did not cultivate wealth for all, and the pecan was not the only one to suffer the effects of greed.

       description="Photo by USDA"
       license="CC 2.0">

The increased number of pecan orchards cultivating improved varieties and the establishment of the pecan as a money-making venture meant that interest in the pecan extended not only to farmers but also to businessmen.[^Ref 56] In San Antonio, for example, Julius Seligmann’s Southern Pecan Shelling Company had taken off as a highly lucrative business, accounting for more than three quarters of the nation’s unshelled pecan purchases.[^Ref 57] But since mechanical advancement did not follow as quickly as pecan growth, Seligmann’s factories still relied on laborers to shell the pecans by hand. His dependence on laborers to shell pecans was not a problem until the country was hit by the Great Depression. Seligmann attempted to maintain his own income by taking advantage of the Mexican American working class.[^Ref 58] By 1938, Seligmann had cut wages by 20%, reducing weekly earnings to about $2 per week ($60 today) while gaining for himself a net income of $500,000[^Ref 59] (an estimated $15 million today).[^Ref 60]

In response to this injustice, the laborers, led by a woman named [Emma Tenayuca,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Tenayuca) initiated the Pecan Shellers’ Strike of 1938, a three-month protest that gained international coverage.[^Ref 61] The strike eventually led to the federal government enacting the <span eid="Q3064514">Fair Labor Standards Act</span>, which resulted in pecan factory workers earning double or even triple what they did before.[^Ref 62] The tragic irony, however, was that, in response to the new law, company managers reduced the number of laborers and invested in pecan shelling machinery. The law enacted to protect laborers resulted in the permanent loss of 10,000 jobs in pecan factories over the next 10 years, and the Pecan Workers Union #172, which led the shellers’ strike, was officially disbanded in 1948.[^Ref 63] Despite leading the charge in labor rights, the laborers of pecan factories became “the only major group of workers displaced as a direct result” of the Fair Labor Standards Act.[^Ref 64]

The treatment of laborers in pecan factories bears a striking resemblance to treatment of pecan trees cultivated on orchard lands. While women and men, seated equidistant from each other on an assembly line, were being valued only according to their level of production, the pecan, homogenized in perfectly planted rows, was valued only for its coveted produce. The wild pecan had officially become a domesticated crop commodity, and the pecan was seen as a tree that existed “to serve not nature’s economy but the human economy.”[^Ref 65] The shift from passive to active cultivation of the pecan was now well established, and the result was that the pecan suffered the same threat of termination as its shellers in San Antonio. Even though this period of immense productivity and agricultural advancement may be seen as a feat of human cultivation, it is also marked by the fraught relationship between humans and the natural world. The ongoing genetic homogenization of the pecan within a capitalistic paradigm threatened the very source of the pecan’s power to adapt and survive: genetic diversity. As time went on, the narrowing gene pool and reduced naturally occurring varieties of the pecan posed significant challenges for farmers, the USDA, and the pecan itself.[^Ref 66]

#### Monoculture: Trade, Economic Growth, and Decreased Genetic Diversity
Over the next forty years, the industrialization of the pecan by way of <span eid="Q220212">Monoculture</span> led to an astronomical increase in pecan production. Twentieth-century capitalist aspirations meant that cultivators prioritized monoculture and its uniform rows, cheap land, and labor costs, all of which led to an increase in pecan production. Pecans were yielding more than Americans could chew. With this high volume, the United States had to figure out what to do with all these nuts. This resulted in the creation of new uses for pecans to address the problem of overproduction. From cereals to breads to candies, culinary chefs concocted new ways to incorporate pecans into their desserts and foods. Luckily, the pecan pie emerged as a staple in the American South— especially New Orleans—during the 1930s, and pecan pie became the most popular new use for pecans by the 1950s. As the number of pecans increased over the years, the dessert became a nationwide classic.[^Ref 67] Nevertheless, even as creative solutions to pecan overproduction may have facilitated new cultural ways of enjoying the pecan, U. S. consumers at some point reached a limit to their pecan consumption, leaving farmers with the same problem: too many nuts.

The trend of high pecan consumption in the United States continued until the 1990s. Americans started consuming fewer pecans, and cereal brands switched from pecans as their nut of choice to walnuts.[^Ref 68] Supply outgrew demand, and pecan farmers had an overabundance of pecans with no consumers. Farmers in the United States were searching around the globe for consumers. Farmers even tried to enter the European market, but there was no place for the pecan since European farmers produced walnuts, which European consumers preferred. It was not until 2006 that American farmers finally found a significant new buyer at a trade show: Chinese representatives tasted an American pecan and decided they wanted cultivated pecans. In 2008, following a global walnut shortage, the Chinese purchased 53 million pounds of pecans.[^Ref 69] The largest pecan exports come from farms in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="31.241, -98.723, 5"> East Texas </span> and <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="32.708, -83.178, 5"> Georgia</span>, then shipped to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="22.3526, 114.1603, 10"> Hong Kong</span>, China. The demand for pecans in China allowed American growers to sell their abundant pecan yield. Today, China is one of America’s top pecan buyers.

Yet American farmers are again in potential trouble. Currently, China is starting its own pecan orchards, and Mexico is starting to dominate the global pecan market. Cultivation of the pecan tree in China and Mexico is driving away the demand from American pecan growers. Since 2005, Mexico has claimed the top spot globally in exporting pecans. Mexico now produces 50% of the global pecan output, while the United States produces 40%.[^Ref 70] Due to the consistently warmer weather and lower labor and land costs in Mexico, Mexico’s pecan production is at an all-time high. Mexico also has extensive acreage available for pecan orchards. Mexico is successfully cultivating the pecan in abundant masses, while American farmers are struggling financially to keep up with Mexico.

The overcultivation of the pecan has led to other serious consequences. Because of monoculture and the uniform rows it requires, there has been a decrease of diversity among the trees in pecan orchards, meaning the pecan has become more susceptible to diseases. As chemicals in pesticides and disease control become more potent, pecan trees and pests are becoming more resistant to these chemicals. For example, <span eid=Q183350> Oleander (yellow) aphids </span> are infesting and destroying cultivated pecan trees in Texas.[^Ref 71] Yellow aphids are not a threat to wild pecan trees because they have natural inhabitants like mesh-web weaver spiders that defend the tree by eating the yellow aphids. Cultivated trees, however, do not contain spiders and other natural defenders due to pesticides, making these trees more susceptible to yellow aphids.[^Ref 72] This dilemma leaves farmers with two choices: buy a more expensive pesticide that the tree or pests have not grown resistant to yet or have their trees die. There is a possibility that one day, pesticides will not work on cultivated pecans. Either way, farmers lose money, and consumers lose their nuts.

#### Wisdom of the Pecan 
Even as pecans have become a global crop and commodity, and perhaps even an endangered one, it's important to remember that this was not always the case. While we could tell one story about pecans–a story of recent exploitation and domination–going back to earlier histories of pecan-human interaction reveal other types of relationships. In particular, Kimmerer has written about the need to remember reciprocal relationships between Indigenous peoples and pecans and argued that returning to those could save both peoples and pecans from threats of extinction. One sentence sums up her main point best: “All Flourishing is mutual.”[^Ref 73] At one level, these words refer to the masting patterns of pecan trees and the hypothesis that mast fruiting helps pecan trees ensure their reproduction by overwhelming the ecosystem with nuts. There are so many nuts produced at the same time that they cannot all be eaten by predators (whether human or non-human). At another level, however, this phrase refers to the general principle of acting in concert with other beings to ensure everyone’s survival. As Kimmerer explains, “If one tree fruits, they all fruit— there are no soloists. Not one tree in a grove, but the whole grove; not one grove in the forest, but every grove; all across the country and all across the state. The trees act not as individuals, but somehow as a collective. Exactly how they do this, we don’t yet know. But what we see is the power of unity. What happens to one happens to us all..”[^Ref 74] While Kimmerer is writing about pecans, she is also writing about Indigenous peoples, whom she explicitly calls on to act together to preserve their rights and cultural heritage, including their relationships with plants like the pecan tree, whose reproductive habits they adapted to versus trying to control. Kimmerer thus asks them, and all of her readers, to think not just about our own interests but of everyone’s: to find ways for all to flourish at the same time, together. 
As is the case with the delicious pecan pie, the sweeter things in life can only exist and be enjoyed when we come together as one.
