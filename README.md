#### Pies and Pronunciations  
Thanksgiving in America arrives once a year, and friends and family members gather around the country to share a pecan pie. The debate on pronouncing this delicious treat will forever be ongoing. Some say that if you live below the Mason-Dixon line, you pronounce the nut as puh-KHAN, but this is not necessarily true. In fact, one poll concluded that 45% of Southern residents say pee-CAN, and so do 70% of Northerners. We want to know how you say it, cast your pronunciation [here.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TPDNWFK)

Whether you pronounce it pee-CAN or puh-KHAN, this cultural classic has a history richer than its tasty Thanksgiving pies. The pecan tree has resisted cultivation for most of its history while showering us with its delicious nut in its characteristic generosity. Today, despite its existence as a domesticated crop and suffering the effects of human greed and attempts at domination, the pecan resiliently offers us a vision of mutual flourishing and communal sharing.

#### Native American Discovery and Use
Native Americans were the first to come into contact with the pecan nut, which they named pakan. Nevertheless, when Native Americans first came to America some 30,000-12,000 years ago, the pecan was already flourishing, as the abundant nut acted as a plentiful food source for many animals across its native region while also contributing to biodiversity. When Native Americans dispersed across America upon arrival, some groups, particularly the Caddo tribe, ended up along the Mississippi River Valley— a prosperous location for the nut— where they built their culture alongside the nut and under it’s trees. The pecan became a Native American staple after a global warming that occurred around 16,000 years ago shifted their agricultural patterns, leading them to become more reliant on the nutritious and abundant pecan during hunting and gathering. Eventually, though, the pecan became more and more popular due to its abundance, resilience, and nutritious components, so much so that Native Americans began to purposefully forage the nut and implement it into their diet. Collecting pecan nuts is fairly easy, considering that native pecan trees abundantly produce pecans. Therefore, foraging pecan nuts from native trees simply meant waiting for the nuts to fall or throwing a stick at the tree to force pecans down. Simple tools like rocks can be used to crack the pecan shell. These nuts also can be boiled and stored for later use, as well as for long periods of time. These attributes make the pecan an accessible and easy nut to forage. Since the pecan tree produced nuts in abundance, there was ample opportunity for individuals to reap the benefits of the crop itself.  In terms of its nutritiousness, “The pecan is a supremely healthy nut. A hundred grams of wild pecans (about two handfuls) pack a nutritional punch: 718 calories, 9.7 grams of protein, 2.4 grams of fiber, 74 grams of fat, and significant doses of critical micronutrients such as iron, potassium, magnesium, beta-carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and ascorbic acid”. It made perfect sense, then, that the pecan fit perfectly into every aspect of Native American diet, as they ate the nut in many different forms and in various ways, including “corn gruel and bread…bison meat…[and] fermented pecan powder into an alcoholic beverage called pawcohicora”. The pecans, then, were a blessed discovery for Native Americans— a discovery that eventually turned into a long-standing and reciprocal relationship.

The pecan, as an essential component of Native American diet and culture, heavily influenced migration patterns due to its specific alternate fruiting and masting patterns. Specifically, the Comanche, Caddo, and Kickapoo tribes not only based their migration patterns off of the pecan's masting schedule, but also may have settled where they did because of its closeness to abundant pecan groves. Although a peculiar phenomenon, the alternate masting quickly became apparent to the Native Americans as some groves would fruit while others would not. Nevertheless, because of the sheer abundance of nuts that the trees would produce, Native Americans did not mind fitting their migration patterns around the pecans’ unusual schedule, as “The pecan trees, to an extent, told them where to go. Indians, fully sold on the nuts worth, followed”. Due to this peculiar fruiting cycle, Native Americans had to find ways to store the pecan. Particularly, the Caddo tribe would store pecans in leather bags to use as a food and trade source throughout the Spring and Winter seasons. Considering that the pecans were fully ingrained in Native American culture and way of life, the pecan eventually became a staple in trading patterns, as different groups would carry around baskets upon baskets full of pecans to exchange with other Native American groups. Although, at this point, Native Americans were in a wholly harmonious relationship with the pecan, the arrival of different groups to the Americas marked an attempt to fracture this relationship.

#### Early European Encounters
In 1533, Spanish explorers became the first Europeans to come into contact with the pecan of <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="34.328981419887434, -90.79370394592483, 5">North America</span>. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a leading explorer and captive of a Native American tribe, recounts being brought to an area southeast of what is now San Antonio, Texas, near the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio Rivers. It was there where he reunited with his fellow Spaniards and discovered a stretch of land on which the fruit of the pecan tree was so numerous that they named it <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="28.507321, -96.891096, 13">"the river of nuts."</span> Interestingly, though, since the pecan bears a striking similarity to the European walnut, as they both belong to the family <span eid="Q216944">Juglandaceae</span>, Europeans did not, at first, see a reason to cultivate a nut they thought they already enjoyed back home. Moreover, the European association of the pecan with perceived “uncivilized” Native American ways may have also contributed to a delayed recognition of the pecan as a delicious nut worth cultivating. In fact, it wasn’t until the turn of the seventeenth century that a French Catholic missionary, Fr. Gabriel Marset, learned from the Native Americans of Illinois that it was distinct from the walnut: “The pecans (it is thus that the fruit of one of the Nut-trees is called) have a better flavor than our nuts in France.”

Even though European acceptance of the pecan as a viable food crop may have been stunted by racial and ethnic discrimination as well as contentment with the familiar walnut, it does not mean there was no interest at all. André Michaux, an eighteenth-century botanist who published one of the first books on the trees of North America, describes the good qualities of the pecan tree, saying that the nuts are “more delicately flavored than those of Europe,” and “the fruit is much larger.” Not only does he affirm the nut’s good qualities, but also he asserts that the active cultivation of the pecan by way of grafting the tree would bring it “to a high degree of perfection…and no motive would discourage its propagation.”

Distinct from the customs of foraging and planting nuts from wild pecan varieties, Michaux was proposing the active cultivation of new pecan varieties through the technique of grafting. Grafting involves combining the stem, or scion, of one tree with the base, or rootstock, of another tree in order to generate a new tree variety. Successful grafting of the pecan tree meant the creation of pecan varieties which would grow faster, bear fruit more frequently, and produce larger and more delicious nuts. Michaux’s prophetic opinion reveals how the shift in the European relationship to the pecan was marked by more than the recognition of a good source of food. Instead, the European impulse to cultivate and perfect the promising nut of the New World marked a shift from the Indigenous way of cooperation to the European colonial way of domination.

#### Reclaiming Enslaved Knowledge
Grafting the pecan was apparently more difficult than Michaux would have hoped. It wasn’t until 1822 in South Carolina when [Abner Landrum,](https://madpotter-oldcanalpottery.blogspot.com/2010/06/dr-abner-landrum.html) a potter by trade, successfully grafted the pecan tree. But Landrum’s success did not come to fruition, and no other farmers seemed to build off of his achievement until years later when a Louisiana landowner had an idea. In St. James Parish, Louisiana, Dr. A. E. Colomb, “cut scions (buds and stems) from a particularly impressive pecan tree” and attempted to graft them onto smaller ones. They did not survive. Hoping someone else might succeed, he gave some of his leftover scions to Télésphore J. Roman, the owner of a plantation called Oak Alley. It was on this Louisiana plantation along the Mississippi River in 1846-47 that Antoine, an enslaved Creole man and a “gardener and expert grafter of Pecan Trees,” became the first person to cultivate an improved pecan variety. Antoine successfully grafted 16 trees of his new variety. Impressed by his work, Roman had him graft another 110 trees. This he also successfully accomplished, demonstrating both the viability of pecan grafting and the possibility of large scale cultivation of the pecan.

	region="-102,16,732,697">

The records from Oak Alley Plantation indicate that Antoine was just 4 years old when he, along with his mother, father, and brother became property of the Roman family. His mother, Zaire, was a spinner of cloth, and his father, Zephyr, occupied the most important position on the plantation: he oversaw the production of sugar. Because “Zephyr held this elite role on the Roman Plantation,” Antoine grew up in the house his father built with the complicated knowledge that “he was enslaved, and he was also the son of a great man.” Antoine cultivated his father’s spirit of greatness as he matured, learning to cooperate with the land while tending his family’s garden behind their slave quarters. We cannot know for sure whether Antoine was intentionally trained for his special skill. We do know, however, that neither Colomb nor Roman–social elites and avid gardeners in their own right–possessed the capacity to perform Antoine’s craft. They relied on his skilled labor, they profited from his success, but they gave him no credit. The sales records reveal that the fruit of his new variety was worth $50-75 a barrel, but Antoine “received no glory or pay for his botanical feat.” Sadly, Antoine found himself in a world in which profit was king, and the pecan he had learned to cultivate would soon face the consequences of the same capitalistic system.

After Télésphore Roman’s death in 1848, care of Oak Alley fell to his wife, Celina. In 1859, determined to save his family’s estate from his mother’s mismanagement, Henry Roman received official ownership. Due to the political and financial strain experienced throughout the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span>, Henry was forced to sell the property to John Armstrong, who foolishly decided to cut down 110 of Antoine’s 126 pecan trees in an effort to bolster sugarcane production. Antoine’s trees were nearly cut down and forgotten. Antoine’s pecan variety managed not only to survive, however, but also to gain national recognition for its superior quality. By 1870, Oak Alley had a new owner named Humbert Bonzano who had new plans for the remaining pecan trees. Bonzano was so impressed by the quality of Antoine’s original 16 pecan trees that he decided “to exhibit Antoine’s improved Pecans at the [Centennial Exposition,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Exposition) held in observance of the nation’s hundredth birthday, in Philadelphia.” The judges who observed and tasted the pecans wrote that they were noteworthy for their “remarkably large size, tenderness of shell, and very special excellence.” Rewarded with such a high review, Antoine’s pecan variety took its official name from the event and became known as the “Centennial.” Antoine’s variety remains among those enjoyed today, and his success in grafting the first improved pecan variety formed a foundation for the ongoing cultivation of the commercialized pecan.

#### Pecan as Commodity 
Indeed, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, pecan grafting allowed the nut to be grown in a more purposeful and organized fashion, transforming the pecan from a “native nut” to a commercialized commodity. The knowledge of, and ability to, graft pecans allowed southern landowners to transform the nut into a business venture, one that became steadily popularized as others realized how easy and profitable it was to grow the versatile and resilient nut.

The popularization of this lucrative business opportunity is apparent in the numerous pamphlets and guides circulated to the public from landowners. These pamphlets educated the reader, assumed to be a beginner-grower, on how to grow and tend to a pecan grove and how to ensure successful profit from it. Specifically, these guides educated the reader on when and where they should grow their pecan groves, what tools they needed to use, how to fight off insects and diseases, and more, to assure proper growth.
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/CAT31332999/page/n2/mode/6up">

But how exactly did the landowners turn this newfound knowledge into a profitable business? In short, the invention of pecan grafting led to increased agricultural yields, consequently leading to increased prices. In addition, pecan growers also started turning the pecan into a commodity by sending out brochures to the public. Primarily, companies like The Oak Ridge Pecan Company turned the nut into a commodity by sending out brochures to individuals or other landowners asking them to “invest” in their pecan groves by proposing why theirs will yield the most profit for the investor. These brochures from various pecan companies all followed a similar layout, which first described the pecan and its use in the business and personal sphere. Additionally, these brochures include a proposition of the land being sold and the price per footage. Companies weren’t the only ones profiting off of the pecan, however, as individuals were also selling their pecan-growing knowledge and abilities to the public. Particularly, and as is the case with pecan grower C.A. Yancey, individuals would both sell the pecan trees that they had grown to others and travel to someone’s land and grow the tree for them there. The brochures and catalogs from individuals are quite interesting, in that they find the individual trying to persuade the landowner to invest in their pecan-growing abilities— as opposed to those of pecan-growing corporations— advocating as to why they are so good at what they do. Typical of this persuasion are testimonials at the end of the brochures, which act as an additional push to convince the pecan-grower’s audience that they are truly the best. These brochures are significant because they mark the beginning of the commercialization of the pecan tree and its fruit, as landowners are either advertising and selling pecan trees and plots, or are selling their pecan-growing expertise to the general public, all for profit. Nevertheless, the pecan did not just become a profitable business because landowners began advertising their pecan-growing abilities.

#### Industrialization, Overproduction, and Resistance
The increased popularity of the pecan, as well as the successful grafting and cultivation of improved varieties, led to a major boom in pecan trees on orchard land.  Between the years 1900 and 1925, the number of orchard pecan trees in the U.S. went up from 567,000 to 8,733,000, exhibiting the greatest increase in the pecan’s history. Despite this abundant increase, growing pecans on orchard land resulted in a major challenge for pecans and its farmers. Since farmers tended to focus their planting on just a few of the most fruitful and delicious varieties, the pecan lost a crucial benefit of genetic diversity: the ability to fight off hungry insects. Pecans may be resilient and farmers may be knowledgeable, but the genetic uniformity of pecan orchards was proving to be a lethal blow to the pecan’s capacity to survive its new commercialized context. This new problem needed a new solution.
<param ve-image
       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Acrobasis_juglandis_1224011.jpg/1599px-Acrobasis_juglandis_1224011.jpg?20120619214135"
       label="Pecan Leaf Casebearer"
       description="Photo by USDA"
       license="Public Domain">

The solution came from an emerging organization of the U.S. Federal Government: the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA’s development of <span eid="Q181322">insecticides</span> helped the pecan overcome the threat of unwelcome pests and gained the confidence of farmers who benefitted from the organization’s chemical creativity. Insecticides may have allowed farmers to save their agricultural enterprises and gain wealth, but it never really addressed the issue of genetic diversity, which was at the root of the problem for the pecan. Thus, pecan orchards, helped by the chemical sciences, followed the path towards financial increase. However, this abundant increase did not cultivate wealth for all, and the pecan was not the only one to suffer the effects of greed.

       description="Photo by USDA"
       license="CC 2.0">

The increased number of pecan orchards cultivating improved varieties and the establishment of the pecan as a money making venture meant that interest in the pecan extended not only to farmers, but also to businessmen. In San Antonio, for example, Julius Seligmann’s Southern Pecan Shelling Company had taken off as a highly lucrative business, accounting for more than three quarters of the nation’s unshelled pecan purchases. But since mechanical advancement did not follow as quickly as pecan growth, Seligmann’s factories still relied on laborers to shell them by hand. His dependance on laborers to shell pecans was not a problem until the country was hit by the Great Depression. Seligmann attempted to maintain his own income by taking advantage of the Mexican American working class. By 1938, Seligmann had cut wages by 20%, reducing weekly earnings to about $2 per week ($60 today) while gaining for himself a net income of $500,000 ($15 million today).

       license="Public Domain">

In response to this injustice, the laborers, led by a woman named [Emma Tenayuca,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Tenayuca) initiated the Pecan Shellers’ Strike of 1938, a three-month protest that gained international coverage. The strike eventually led to the federal government enacting the <span eid="Q3064514">Fair Labor Standards Act</span>, which resulted in pecan factory workers earning double or even triple what they did before. The tragic irony, however, was that the new law also motivated companies to reduce the number of laborers and invest in pecan shelling machinery. The law enacted to protect laborers resulted in the permanent loss of 10,000 jobs in pecan factories over the next 10 years, and the Pecan Workers Union #172, which led the shellers’ strike, was officially disbanded in 1948. Despite leading the charge in labor rights, the laborers of pecan factories became “the only major group of workers displaced as a direct result” of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

       license="Fair Use">

The working conditions and pay for laborers of pecan factories bears a striking resemblance to the pecan trees cultivated on orchard lands. While women and men, seated equidistant from each other on an assembly line, were being valued only according to their level of production, the pecan, homogenized in perfectly planted rows, was valued only for its coveted produce. The wild pecan had officially become a domesticated crop, and the pecan was seen as a tree which exists “to serve not nature’s economy but the human economy.” The shift from passive to active cultivation of the pecan was now well established, and the result was that the pecan suffered the same threat as its shellers in San Antonio. Even though this period of immense productivity and agricultural advancement may be seen as a feat of human cultivation, it is also marked by the fraught relationship between humans and the natural world. The ongoing genetic homogenization of the pecan within a capitalistic paradigm threatened the very source of the pecan’s power to adapt and survive: genetic diversity. As time went on, the narrowing gene pool and reduced naturally occurring varieties of the pecan posed significant challenges for farmers, the USDA, and the pecan itself.

#### Trade and Economic Growth
Over the next forty years, the industrialization of the pecan led to an astronomical increase in pecan production. Pecans were yielding more than Americans could chew. With this high volume, the United States had to figure out what to do with all these nuts. This resulted in the government creating contracts and new foods to address the problem of overproduction. From cereals, to breads, to candies, culinary chefs were concocting new ways to incorporate pecans into their desserts and foods. Luckily, the pecan pie emerged as a Thanksgiving staple in the American South— especially New Orleans— during the 1930s. Therefore, in the 1950s, the most popular solution to pecan overproduction became the pecan pie. As the number of pecans increased over the years, the dessert became a nationwide classic. The association between pecan pie and Thanksgiving is due to the fact that pecans are harvested in the Fall. The U.S. government’s creative solution to pecan overproduction may have facilitated cultural ways of enjoying the pecan, but eventually caused consumers to start rejecting the nut entirely, leaving farmers with the same problem: too many nuts.

The trend of high pecan consumption in the United States continued until the 1990s. Americans started growing sick of pecans, and cereal brands switched from pecans as their nut of choice to walnuts. Supply outgrew demand, and pecan farmers had an overabundance of pecans with no consumers; farmers needed to find someone to eat their pecans! Farmers in the United States were searching around the globe for consumers, since during this time, America rejected the nut. Farmers even tried to enter the European market, but there was no place for the pecan since European farmers produced walnuts. It wasn’t until 2006 that they finally found a buyer at a trade show. At the trade show, Chinese consumers tasted an American pecan and decided they wanted the farmers’ cultivated pecans.In 2008, following a global walnut shortage, the Chinese purchased 53 million pounds of pecans. The largest pecan exports come from farms in <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="31.241, -98.723, 5"> East Texas </span> and <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="32.708, -83.178, 5"> Georgia</span>, then shipped to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="22.3526, 114.1603, 10"> Hong Kong</span>, China. The demand for pecans in China allowed American growers to sell their abundant pecan yield. Today, China is one of America’s top pecan buyers.

Currently, China is starting its own pecan orchards, and Mexico is starting to dominate the global pecan market. Cultivation of the pecan tree in China and Mexico is driving away the demand from American pecan growers. Since 2005, Mexico has claimed the top spot globally in exporting pecans. Mexico now produces 50% of the global pecan output while the United States only produces 40%. Due to the consistently warmer weather and lower labor costs, Mexico’s pecan production is at an all-time high. Mexico also has room for extensive acreage of pecan orchards. Mexico is successfully cultivating the pecan in abundant masses, while American farmers are struggling financially to keep up with Mexico. With this, the pecan’s native country is failing the pecan itself.

#### Decreased Genetic Diversity
The cultivation of the pecan has caused serious consequences. With the lack of diversity among the trees in pecan orchards, the pecan has become more susceptible to diseases and species that transmit diseases. As chemicals in pesticides and disease control become more potent, pecan trees and pests are becoming more resistant to these chemicals. For example, <span eid=Q183350> Oleander (yellow) aphids </span> are infesting and destroying cultivated pecan trees in Texas. Yellow aphids are not a threat to wild pecan trees because they have natural inhabitants that defend the tree by eating the yellow aphids, like Mesh-web weaver spiders (Dictynidae). Cultivated trees, however, do not contain spiders and other natural defenders due to pesticides, making these trees more susceptible to yellow aphids. This epidemic leaves farmers with two choices: buy a more expensive pesticide that the tree or pests have not grown resistant to yet or have their trees die. There is a possibility that one day pesticides will not work on cultivated pecans. Either way, farmers lose money, and consumers lose their nuts.

#### Wisdom of the Pecan 
Even as pecans have become a global crop and commodity, it's important to remember that this wasn’t always the case. The pecan’s first interaction with humans was balanced and devoid of exploitation, as Native Americans retrieved pecans only when needed— carrying them with them on long journeys or picking them up during stretches of hunting and gathering. In return, Native Americans gave back to the pecan in a reciprocal manner. In the spirit of Indigenous tradition, there are many lessons that humans can take from this wise nut, rather than just sitting back and marveling at its strength and resilience against overproduction and commodification.
Potowatami botanist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer has written much about the pecan and its cultural significance for her tribe, a significance that yields teachable moments for all. Specifically, Kimmerer has offered an antidote for the shakiness of the future in her phrase, “All Flourishing is Mutual” from her chapter “The Council of Pecans” in Braiding Sweetgrass. Here, Kimmerer illustrates that harmony can only be achieved if there is a reciprocal and cooperative relationship between all living beings:“If one tree fruits, they all fruit— there are no soloists. Not one tree in a grove, but the whole grove; not one grove in the forest, but every grove; all across the country and all across the state. The trees act not as individuals, but somehow as a collective. Exactly how they do this, we don’t yet know. But what we see is the power of unity. What happens to one happens to us all. We can starve together or feast together. All flourishing is mutual”.

This brief excerpt from Kimmerer speaks grand volumes to the importance of unity and the ways in which what happens to one, happens to all. Kimmerer’s wisdom here can be applied in a few different ways. First, within pecans themselves, the synchronous flourishing demonstrated in their mast-fruiting patterns illustrates a communicative harmony entrenched within their social DNA. Second, within the relationship between humans and pecans— and all nature we share a relationship with, really—, is the simple fact that if humans do not start respecting, protecting, and nurturing the pecan, that it will ultimately cease to provide its gifts for us; and we would be to blame. Lastly, Kimmer’s wisdom here can act as a metaphor for human interpersonal relationships. That is, if we cannot live in harmony and with a mutual understanding of one another, then our flourishing is out of the question. Whatever the case may be, though, Kimmer’s wisdom and the story of the pecan and its resilience proves itself to be an indispensable, invaluable lesson for our life today, that of which becomes more relevant if we want to see our life tomorrow. As is the case with the delicious pecan pie, the sweeter things in life can only exist and be enjoyed when we come together as one.
